# NocturneRecomp-Mods

Source for the built-in mod examples for
[NocturneRecomp](https://github.com/birabittoh/NocturneRecomp). See that
repo's `docs/making-mods.md` for the mod-authoring guide (plugin ABI, shared
mod registry, `mod.toml` format, etc.).

## Layout

```
src/<name>/       mod source (was mods_src/<name>/ in the main repo)
src/common/       shared CMake helper + header-only include/ used by mods
scripts/          build tooling
```

## Building

```
python scripts/download-sdk.py --pinned
python scripts/make_mods.py
```

`make_mods.py` builds every `src/<name>/` project for the host's own
platform by default (`--target` to pick one of `windows-x64`, `linux-x64`,
`linux-arm64` explicitly, repeatable) and assembles the result into
`mods/<name>/code/<platform>/`. Pass `--mod <name>` (repeatable) to build a
subset, `--package` to also zip each mod individually.

Binaries live under `code/<platform>/` (`code/windows-x64/<name>.dll`,
`code/linux-x64/lib<name>.so`, `code/linux-arm64/lib<name>.so`) rather than
flat in `code/`, so one mod folder can carry all three platforms' binaries
at once without the two `.so` builds colliding on the same filename.
NocturneRecomp's mod loader checks `code/<platform>/<stem>...` (matching
the running host) before falling back to a flat `code/<stem>...`.
